Version 2.1.1 (2018-03)
    o ICL can be used if there is no variable selection
    o Input data can be stored in a matrix (then, Gaussian mixture is considered)
    o Bug fixed: AIC is now computed if only one component is considered
    o Reference to Journal of Classification for Marbac, M. and Patin, E. and Sedki, M. (2018)

Version 2.1 (2018-03)
    o Interface Shiny is available to analyze the clustering results (use function VarSelShiny on the clustering output).
    o Modification of the class returned by the clustering function (results obtained by old version of VarSelLCM need to be convert by using the function VarSelConvert).
    o Modification of the plot functions (ggplot2).
    o Imputation fonction permits the imputation of missing values based on the model parameters (use function VarSelImputation).

Version 2.0 (2017-10)
    o Mixed-data are allowed (continuous, integer and categorical).
    o Missing values can be managed by assuming that values are missing completly at random.
    o Model selection can be done with BIC (optimized by a specific EM algorithm).
